## Jaden Case

### Quick little responsive Web app built with React. It transforms sentences into tweetable Jaden Case. What is Jaden Case? It is the capitalization of each word in a sentence. Jaden Smith popularized this peculiar way of writing in his Twitter Feed. This project was inspired by a Code Wars challenge. I thought it would be fun to code it up. I wrote a blog post about it too. Tested with Jest.
