## Jaden Case
### Quick little  React project that transforms text into Jaden Case. What is Jaden Case? Each letter in the sentence is capitalized because that's how Jaden rolls. This project was inspired by a Code Wars challenge. I thought it would be fun to code it up. I wrote a blog post about it too. Tested with Jest.
